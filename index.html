  <h3>WWW - World Wide Web</h3>
  <p>
    The world wide web is a collection of HTML documents. At the time of this lesson approximately 30 billion documents make up the web.
    HTML, or hypertext markup language, is the language of the world wide web. It is the basic building blocks for the documents on the web.
    When you are browsing the web and you enter a URL into your browser your computer sends an HTTP request to server corresponding to that
    address. The server repsonds back by sending the file or webpage you requested with the URL.
  </p>
  <h3>HTML</h3>
  <p>
    Hypertext markup language is the heart of the web. It is made up of text content (what you see on a page), markup (what tells you browser
    how to arrange the content on the page), references to other documents (images and videos), and links to other pages.
  </p>
  <h4>HTML Markup</h4>
  <p>
    Markup is the tags and attributes that tell the browser how to display a webpage. It has the following format:
    <br><br>
    <code>
    &lt;tag&gt;Contents&lt;/tag&gt;
    </code>
  </p>
  <p>Other examples of tags are the bold tag: <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>
  <br>
    The emphasis tag: <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>
  <br>
    And the line break tag: <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>
  </p>
  <h3>Computers are Stupid</h3>
  <p>
    A computer can only interpret instructions exactly as you have entered them. It does not infer, and it does not guess.
  </p>
  <h3>HTML Attributes</h3>
  <p>
    Attributes provide more information about an HTML element. They have the following format:
    <br><br>
    <code>&lt;tag attr="value"&gt;Contents&lt;/tag&gt;</code>
    <br><br>
    Examples include the anchor tag: <code>&lt;a href="URL"&gt;Link Text&lt;/a&gt;</code>
    <br>
    And the image tag: <code>&lt;img src="URL" alt="TEXT"&gt;</code> (Note that the image tag is a void tag. It does not have
    contents and does not require a closing tag.)
  </p>
  <h3>Whitespace - Inline vs. Block</h3>
  <p>
    Inline elements are exactly like they sound. They work inline without breaks. Block elements create an invisible box around
    its contents and break to a new line.
